But in general, one has to specify a great deal more. If, for instance, one would like to obtain a color image from the color image, one needs to specify how each of the three channels get mapped onto each of the new channels.\n",

        "This is naturally described in terms of some linear algebra. A color image is like a black-and-white image, except each pixel is specified by a 3-dimensional vector instead of a scalar. When applying a convolution in order to obtain another color image, then, one specifies, instead of a 3x3 grid of scalars, a 3x3 grid of linear transformations from 3-space to 3-space. That's a lot more to specify -- if the kernel is 3 x 3, that's 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 degrees of freedom! Hence the choice to do this in black-and-white.\n",

        "For convolutional neural networks, one isn't restricted in mapping color images to color images at each layer. In general, an arbitrary number of channels can be used. So convolutions, in general, are specified by grids of linear transformations from the input channel size to the output channel size. In many cases, the channel size grows in successive layers."
