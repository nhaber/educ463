  <h1>Project timeline</h1>
  <div class='text-center'>
    <p>Students will scope a potential application of computer vision of interest to them (ideally, applied to their research!). Projects can be done solo or with one partner. In addition to the milestones described below, we will devote class time to workshopping project ideas, issues, and progress. Please come prepared to discuss!</p>

<h2>Jan 19 and 24: project scoping presentations</h2>
<p>
The purpose of this first project milestone is both to get you all thinking about these early and to spread and workshop ideas in class. By now, you should have identified whether you are doing the project solo or with a partner, and if with a partner, who that partner is.</p>
<p>For this, each project group will give short presentations of the project idea (or ideas, if you cannot decide). This should give us a sense of background for the application, the data plan -- what existing data to use (e.g. "I have this dataset/I'll use this publicly-available dataset") or a plan to capture it (should be easy, e.g. "Over the next two weeks, I'll record X on my phone/webcam..."), and a computer vision task you want to try. If you are working with sensitive data, you should identify publicly shareable proxy data that will allow us to get a sense of what you are working on.</p>
<p>Please come prepared with slides. Consider a simple 3-slide structure (background, data plan, computer vision task) -- this should not be a heavy lift!
<p>Please submit slides to the corresponding Canvas assignment -- if working with a partner, it's fine to submit under either name (just make sure both names are clear on the submission).</p>
<p>Feel free to post in #project_ideas on Slack if you're looking to form a team.</p>

<h2>Feb 23 and 28: project update presentations</h2>
<p>In this brief presentation, you will update on project progress. This presentation should include (1) identification of scoping refinements and shifts, (2) a first demo in which you apply some computer vision technique (need not be your end application -- this can be super lightweight, e.g. using an out-of-the-box tool and display a possibly-not-working result), and (3) thoughts on where you would like to take the project for the rest of the quarter.</p>

<h2>Due end of day March 1: Formal feedback</h2>
<p>Students will provide brief written constructive feedback and suggestions on two of the projects -- suggestions for students to follow up on.</p>
</div>

<h2>Mar 9: project presentations.</h2>
<p>Final presentations! Slide presentations --- remind us of where you were last check-in, describe what's happened since then, and describe where you might like to go from here.</div>
