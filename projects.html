  <h1>Project timeline</h1>
  <div class='text-center'>
    <p>Students will scope a potential application of computer vision of interest to them (ideally, applied to their research!). Projects can be done solo or with one partner. In addition to the milestones described below, we will devote class time to workshopping project ideas, issues, and progress. Please come prepared to discuss!</p>

<h2>Jan 25: project scoping pitches</h2>
<p>
The purpose of this first project milestone is to get you all thinking about these early, to spread and workshop ideas in class, and to help with matchmaking for group work. If you have already found a partner, you may pitch with that partner.</p>

<p>Each person or group will give short (2 min) pitches of the project idea (or ideas, if you have more than one idea). Please come with 1-2 slides! Ideas need not be at all finalized. Feel free to post in #project_ideas on Slack if you're looking to form a team.</p>

<p>Please submit slides to the corresponding Canvas assignment -- if working with a partner, it's fine to submit under either name (just make sure both names are clear on the submission).</p>

  <h2>Feb 1: Project scoping follow-up.</h2>
<p>By now, you should have narrowed down a project idea, and if working with a partner, who that partner is. You will submit a brief (half to full page) writeup of your plans. This should give us a sense of background for the application, the data plan -- what existing data to use (e.g. "I have this dataset/I'll use this publicly-available dataset") or a plan to capture it (should be easy, e.g. "Over the next two weeks, I'll record X on my phone/webcam..."), and a computer vision task you want to try. If you are working with sensitive data, you should identify publicly shareable proxy data that will allow us to get a sense of what you are working on.</p>
<p>This will be submitted in Canvas, and we'll follow up with comments.</p>

<h2>Feb 22: project update report and workshopping</h2>
<p>In this brief (1-2 page) report, you will update on project progress. This presentation should include (1) identification of scoping refinements and shifts, (2) a first demo in which you apply some computer vision technique (need not be your end application -- this can be super lightweight, e.g. using an out-of-the-box tool and display a possibly-not-working result), and (3) thoughts on where you would like to take the project for the rest of the quarter. Include figures!</p>
<p>In class that day, we will workshop projects for an extended time in small groups. Please come prepared with your writeups and any other visuals/demos you think would be useful.</p>

<h2>Mar 13 and 15: project presentations.</h2>
<p>Final presentations! Slide presentations --- remind us of where you were last check-in, describe what's happened since then, and describe where you might like to go from here.</div>

<div class="container sec">
<h2>Mar 15: Final report.</h2>
<p>Please provide a final report, 4 pages. Introduce the application with background, tell us your method, describe the results obtained so far, and provide conclusions and next steps.
