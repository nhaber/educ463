  <h1>Project timeline</h1>
  <div class='text-center'>
    <p>Students will scope a potential application of computer vision of interest to them (ideally, applied to their research!). Projects can be done solo or with one partner. In addition to the milestones described below, we will devote class time to workshopping project ideas, issues, and progress. Please come prepared to discuss!</p>

<h2>April 14 by end of day: project scoping</h2>
<p>
The purpose of this first project milestone is threefold: to get you all thinking about these early, and to let us know what you are thinking about so that we can start to guide and help. By now, you should have identified whether you are doing the project solo or with a partner, and if with a partner, who that partner is.</p>
<p>For this, we are simply looking for a 1-paragraph statement of the project scope. This should identify both the intended outcome of the project, as well as the data plan -- what existing data to use (e.g. "I have this dataset/I'll use this publicly-available dataset") or a plan to capture it (should be easy, e.g. "Over the next two weeks, I'll record X on my phone/webcam..."). Classes up to and including the April 14 deadline will have time dedicated to workshopping ideas. Give this some thought, and come prepared to participate!</p>
<p>Please submit to the corresponding Canvas assignment -- if working with a partner, it's fine to submit under either name (just make sure both names are clear on the submission).</p>
<p>Feel free to post in #project_ideas on Slack if you're looking to form a team.</p>

<h2>April 30 by end of day: project update</h2>
<p>This is a writeup that details progress made on data access/infrastructure, as well as showcasing a first computer vision application. The purpose of this is to make sure everyone has access to data and can manipulate it, as well as to make sure they've set themselves up to do some compute. The first application can be super lightweight...e.g. use some out-of-the-box tool and display a (possibly not-working) result.</p>

<h2>Week of May 10: project check-in with instructor</h2>
<p>In this week, we will schedule brief (~10 min) office hours to complement class discussion. Feel free to request additional office hours. This is meant to serve as a minimal touchpoint!</p>
</div>

<div class="container sec">
<h2>Week of May 24: project presentations.</h2>
<p>This consists of a very brief pitch with slides (stay tuned for time limit...), followed by discussion.
</div>

<div class="sechighlight">
<div class="container sec">
<h2>June 2: project reports due.</h2>
<p>This has two deliverables: (1) a brief writeup of background and motivation for the application, a review of the technique used, and a summary of results (a product ideal for a workshop or conference submission), and (2) a working demonstration of the application that others could use (e.g. using a Jupyter notebook, with well-documented/automated setup). Part of the goal here is to enrich future iterations of the class by allowing us to showcase what others have done.</p>
