  <h2>Course Description</h2>

  <div id="coursedesc">
<p>Computer vision -- the study of how to design artificial systems that can perform high-level tasks related to image or video data (e.g. recognizing and locating objects in images and behaviors in videos, or generating photorealistic, imagined data) -- has seen dramatic successes in recent years. In this course, we seek to give education and social science researchers the know-how needed to apply cutting edge computer vision algorithms in their work as well as an opportunity to workshop applications in their domains of interest. Particular application domains of interest include (1) building computer vision-powered tools which can be applied in educational settings, and (2) the analysis of human behavioral data. However, this course is meant to be useful for a wide variety of use cases, and aspects of it can be tailored to individual interest. Students will complete a project component where they will apply such a technique in a domain of their choosing.</p>

<p>The first iteration of this course will be part lecture (in which I give a survey of computer vision tools and explain the basics of their inner workings), part seminar (in which we workshop a wide variety of application ideas, many hopefully student-inspired), and part lab (in which we prototype applications). We'll look to draw from the students taking the course for application ideas, but to give you a sense, here are a couple of prime examples:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Education and social science research often uses, or could gainfully use, video data, which is manually coded by researchers (often for high-level semantic content, e.g. engagement or affect). In some cases, computer vision has the capability of automating large aspects of this process. In other cases, it has the potential to aid manual coding, greatly reducing the effort of researchers. In either case, it may be possible to drastically increase the scale of data analysis as well as add a wide variety of additional quantitative metrics.</li>
    <li>A wide variety of computer vision techniques (e.g. affect recognition, object recognition, and object localization) have promising applications in educational technologies. For example, in previous work, I and many others worked on a computer-vision powered tool for children with autism using Google Glass. There is tremendous opportunity to prototype new tools, toys, and aids.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>Who is this class for?</h3> 
<p>It's very useful for you to have some background in programming, though we will tailor the course and scope projects so that it is suitable for a wide variety of backgrounds. Most importantly, you should be interested in these sorts of applications! Stanford offers a number of excellent computer sciences centered on computer vision, and we'll look to distinguish this one for the opportunity to workshop and prototype application ideas.</p>

<h3>What's computer vision?</h3>
<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-computer-vision-heres-a-look-why-it-s-so-awesome-e8a58dfb641e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here</a> is a high-level blog post about it and its many capabilities.

<h3>Do I need to come in with a dataset or particular application in mind?</h3>
No! These are welcome, but we'll work together to find useful data with which to play.

<h3>What level of coding is involved?</h3>
We'll look to make this accessible to those with a wide variety of backgrounds. By then end, we hope you'll be able to take existing computer vision tools (either high-level tools, like those provided by Google AI Platform, or lower level, like someone's GitHub repo), try them out in some new application, and troubleshoot if they do not work. So this will likely be less demanding than CS vision courses (and perhaps a good stepping stone to them), and if you are, for example, comfortable manipulating and analyzing data in some language, and have at least some familiarity with python, this course could work well for you.

  <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
  <p>This course is intended to attract a broad range of students interested in applying these methods, and in particular students who do not have significant experience taking computer science courses. Project milestones will be tailored so as to be appropriate for each studentâ€™s background, and we'll make sure you feel supported in all technical aspects.

  <ul>
    <li><span class="spanh">Students should have some proficiency in at least one programming language. It's helpful to be able to find one's way around simple python scripts, but if you're strongly motivated, you should be able to pick up the needed basics.</li>
    <li><span class="spanh">Students should have some experience performing statistical analysis on data.</li>
    <li><span class="spanh">A working knowledge in linear algebra, calculus, data science, and statistics (MATH 19, 41, or 51, EDUC400b, 423, 423a, or equivalent) is useful but not at all required.</li>

  <h2>Learning objectives & student responsibilities</h2>
<p>Students should walk away from the course with three general skills:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="spanh">A basic familiarity with a wide variety of successful computer vision tools,</li>
    <li><span class="spanh">enough fluency in the field so that, for a particular application, they can attempt to find a suitable computer vision tool, locate a codebase or API for it, and apply it in their setting, and</li>
    <li><span class="spanh">the ability to troubleshoot, and in some cases adapt, their computer vision applications.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Topics at-a-glance</h2>
  <p>Forthcoming, supplementary readings and further details, as applicable. Topics subject to modifications.</p>
<h3>Unit 1: Getting started</h3>
<p>We take a first look at what is possible with computer vision. Before spending too much time on a full range of possibilities, we take a practical dive into how to get started with ready-made, high-level tools.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Class 1: Introduction to deep learning and computer vision</li>
    <li>Class 2: Image classification, and using out-of-the-box tools.</li>
  </ul>
<h3>Unit 2: A whirlwind tour of some current high-performance computer vision systems.</h3>
<p>We look closely at a number of current systems. Here, class will be a mix between lecture and open-ended discussion on potential applications of these tools.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Class 3: Image detection and segmentation</li>
    <li>Class 4: Pose estimation, gesture, affect, and activity recognition</li>
    <li>Class 5: Generative models</li>
    <li>Class 6: Practicum on using these tools</li>
  </ul>
<h3>Unit 3: The inner workings of a deep learning model</h3>
<p>The goal of this class is not to be able to implement all of the above algorithms ourselves. However, in applying any of these, it is useful to have some intuition for how they work. Fortunately, many current methods have a great deal of commonality. Hence, here we will look in some detail at how image classification works.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Class 7: Neural network models, loss functions, optimization, deep learning architectures.</li>
    <li>Class 8: Deep learning practicum: data formatting, training, validation, hyperparameter tuning, visualization</li>
  </ul>
<h3>Unit 4: Finding useful tools, and getting started with them.</h3>
<p>Sometimes, very standardized industry tools work well for our purposes. However, a much wider variety of tools is available for free, in the form of model implementations in released codebases. In this unit, we will look at how to evaluate computer vision research papers and how to get started with corresponding implementations. Come prepared to talk through your project efforts.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Class 9: Identifying strong and weak benchmarks.</li>
    <li>Class 10: Reading and evaluating deep learning research papers, part 1</li>
    <li>Class 11: Reading and evaluating deep learning research papers, part 2</li>
    <li>Class 12: Practicum: finding and adapting code on github.</li>
  </ul>
<h3>Unit 5: What can go wrong?</h3>
<p>In this section, weâ€™ll examine common pitfalls in trying to apply computer vision tools.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Class 13: Common data issues</li>
    <li>Class 14: Common training and test issues</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Unit 6: Applying computer vision to human behavior</h3>
<p>In this unit, weâ€™ll look in some detail at the prospect of applying computer vision in human behavioral work.</p>
  <ul>
